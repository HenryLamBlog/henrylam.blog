        <h2>Sourcing Components</h2>
        <p>Armed with knowledge, I embarked on the next phase of my endeavor: sourcing the necessary components. Assembling an iPhone from scratch requires meticulous attention to detail and access to genuine parts. Scouring online marketplaces and specialized stores, I carefully curated a collection of components, ensuring authenticity and quality.</p>
        <p>I traveled to Shenzhen, China, home to the world's biggest electronic market – Huaqiangbei electronics market. Here, I endeavored to find, buy, and gather the different iPhone parts. It was a daunting task, especially considering it was my first time visiting the bustling market and conversing with sellers in Mandarin. However, armed with bravery and determination, I navigated through the labyrinthine alleys, bargaining for the best prices and negotiating with vendors.</p>
